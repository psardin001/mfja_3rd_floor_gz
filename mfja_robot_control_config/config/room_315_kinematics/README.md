# Room 315 Kinematic Rail Network

This directory contains the Room 315 kinematic-first shuttle network. The
shuttle is controlled by graph routing and an arc-length path backend generated
from CSV rail geometry, then pushed into Gazebo with `set_pose`. Contact
dynamics, wheel physics, and rail contact are intentionally not part of this
phase.

The repository root `README.md` contains the full operator guide for launching
Gazebo, running one or more shuttles, adding shuttles at runtime, changing
switch states, and controlling the robots.

## Files

- `raw_segments/`: source CSV files for the directed rail segments.
- `normalized_segments/`: preprocessed CSV files with duplicate points removed,
  arc length, tangent, and yaw columns.
- `rail_network_right.yaml`: explicit graph topology for the right rail: nodes,
  segments, switches, fixed transitions, and block placeholders.
- `rail_network_left.yaml`: explicit graph topology for the left rail with its
  own switch labeling and routing layout.
- `rail_devices_right.yaml`: user-editable right-rail slots, position sensors,
  approach sensors, and stoppers.
- `rail_devices_left.yaml`: user-editable left-rail slots, position sensors,
  approach sensors, and stoppers.
- `segment_summary.yaml`: preprocessing summary generated from the raw CSVs.
- `validation_report.yaml`: validation results for lengths, snap distances,
  endpoint gaps, and tangent mismatches.
- `continuous_path_report.yaml`: validation results comparing the continuous
  path backend against the direct CSV polyline reference.
- `debug_plots/`: generated visual debug plots of the rail network.

## Segment Direction

Every rail segment is one-way only. Motion always follows the CSV order from
`index=0` to the last row in that file. The geometry is used for pose
interpolation only. Routing is decided by `rail_network_right.yaml`, not by exact
endpoint equality.

If a shuttle reaches the end of a segment and the graph has no valid successor
for the current switch state, the shuttle enters `FALLING` mode instead of
silently correcting or teleporting.

## Path Backends

The calibrated CSV files remain the source of truth, but runtime motion can be
sampled in two ways:

- `cubic_hermite`: recommended default. It creates a continuous path from CSV
  points and tangents, then reparameterizes it by arc length.
- `polyline`: direct CSV polyline interpolation used as a reference and debug
  backend.

Use `cubic_hermite` for normal demos and `polyline` only when comparing the
continuous path against the measured CSV points.

## Rail Device YAML

Phase 1 moves Room 315 rail devices out of the topology YAMLs and into:

```text
rail_devices_right.yaml
rail_devices_left.yaml
```

The shuttle node has a `devices_yaml` parameter. If it is empty, the node picks
`rail_devices_right.yaml` for `rail_side:=right` and `rail_devices_left.yaml`
for `rail_side:=left`. To test a custom device file, pass:

```bash
ros2 run mfja_robot_control_config room_315_kinematic_shuttle_node.py --ros-args \
  -p devices_yaml:=/absolute/path/to/my_devices.yaml
```

Each device is placed on a rail segment with `segment` and `s_ratio`:

```yaml
position_sensors:
  - name: DZI1R
    segment: A12E
    s_ratio: 0.411866742
    radius_m: 0.09
```

`segment` must match a segment in the active rail network YAML. `s_ratio` is a
normalized distance along that segment, where `0.0` is the start of the segment
and `1.0` is the end. Runtime arc length is computed as:

```text
s = s_ratio * segment.length
```

The node then resolves device pose from the existing
`SegmentGeometry.sample(s)` method.

To move a sensor, stopper, or slot, edit only its `segment` and `s_ratio` in the
matching rail device YAML. For example, moving `DA1R` slightly upstream means
decreasing its `s_ratio` on `A14`. For stoppers or approach sensors that cover
two converging branch segments, keep one public device name and edit the
individual entries under `points:`.

You can also compute `segment` and `s_ratio` from a Gazebo XYZ coordinate with
`room_315_device_position_tool.py`. This is useful when you pick a sensor
position visually in Gazebo:

```bash
cd /home/tiago/ALI_ros2_ws/src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz
python3 mfja_robot_control_config/scripts/room_315_device_position_tool.py \
  --side right \
  --category position_sensors \
  --name DZI1R \
  --x -14.95 \
  --y -3.86 \
  --z 0.84
```

The command prints the nearest rail `segment`, `s`, `s_ratio`, and the distance
from the requested Gazebo point to the rail. It does not edit YAML unless you
add `--write`:

```bash
python3 mfja_robot_control_config/scripts/room_315_device_position_tool.py \
  --side right \
  --category position_sensors \
  --name DZI1R \
  --x -14.95 \
  --y -3.86 \
  --z 0.84 \
  --write
```

For devices that use `points:`, select the point with `--point-index`.
The tool refuses to write when the point is far from the rail unless `--force`
is passed.

Topics, namespaces, and message types are unchanged in this phase. The approach
sensor topic is still `/room_315_right/sensors/switch_approach` or
`/room_315_left/sensors/switch_approach`, the position sensor topic is still
`/room_315_right/sensors/position` or `/room_315_left/sensors/position`, and the
messages are still `std_msgs/msg/String` JSON payloads.

## Validate Rail Devices

Run the device validator after editing either rail device YAML:

```bash
cd /home/tiago/ALI_ros2_ws/src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz
python3 mfja_robot_control_config/scripts/room_315_devices_validator.py
```

The validator checks both `rail_devices_right.yaml` and
`rail_devices_left.yaml` against their matching rail network files. It reports
`PASS`, `WARN`, or `FAIL` and checks required fields, segment references,
`s_ratio`, duplicate names, marker radii/distances, and stopper default states.

## Gazebo Device Markers

The kinematic shuttle node spawns visual-only Gazebo markers from the loaded
device YAML when `enable_device_markers` is true. This is enabled by default and
uses the existing Gazebo create/remove services. Markers are static SDF models
with a single visual and no collision element, so they do not affect physics.
Markers are spawned gradually instead of all at once so Gazebo has time to
accept every create request.

Colors:

- slots: green
- position sensors: blue
- approach sensors: cyan
- stoppers: red

Example marker names:

```text
marker_right_DZI1R
marker_right_stopper_A1
marker_left_slot_1
```

To test marker movement, edit a device `segment` or `s_ratio` in the matching
`rail_devices_*.yaml`, rebuild or use a symlink install, then relaunch Gazebo
and the shuttle node. The marker will be recreated at the new
`SegmentGeometry.sample(s_ratio * segment.length)` position.

## Regenerate Preprocessed Data

Run these commands from the repository root after editing any file in
`raw_segments/` or after changing the network topology:

```bash
cd /home/tiago/ALI_ros2_ws/src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz

python3 mfja_robot_control_config/scripts/room_315_csv_preprocessor.py
python3 mfja_robot_control_config/scripts/room_315_network_validator.py
python3 mfja_robot_control_config/scripts/room_315_continuous_path_validator.py
python3 mfja_robot_control_config/scripts/room_315_segment_plot.py
```

Expected validation result:

```text
Validated 14 segments and 12 nodes.
Status: PASS (0 warnings)
```

The continuous path validator also prints:

```text
Validated continuous paths for 14 segments.
Status: PASS (0 warnings)
```

## Build After Changes

Use the meta-repository build command from the workspace root:

```bash
cd /home/tiago/ALI_ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash

colcon build --base-paths \
  src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz/mfja_robot_control_config \
  src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz/mfja_3rd_floor_description \
  src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz/mfja_room_315_bringup \
  src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz/mfja_3rd_floor_bringup \
  src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz/mfja_3rd_floor_gz \
  --packages-select \
  mfja_robot_control_config \
  mfja_3rd_floor_description \
  mfja_room_315_bringup \
  mfja_3rd_floor_bringup \
  mfja_3rd_floor_gz \
  --symlink-install

source install/setup.bash
```

## Quick Runtime Example

Start Room 315 only:

```bash
cd /home/tiago/ALI_ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

ros2 launch mfja_room_315_bringup room_315_only.launch.py \
  robots:=none \
  start_paused:=false \
  gui:=true
```

Start the kinematic shuttle node:

```bash
cd /home/tiago/ALI_ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

ros2 run mfja_robot_control_config room_315_kinematic_shuttle_node.py --ros-args \
  -p gazebo_world_name:=room_315_only \
  -p start_slot:=2 \
  -p path_backend:=cubic_hermite \
  -p enable_gazebo_set_pose:=true \
  -p enable_gazebo_spawn:=true \
  -p speed:=0.2 \
  -p gazebo_set_pose_rate_hz:=10.0
```

For full-floor operation, use the same shuttle node and change only the world
name:

```bash
-p gazebo_world_name:=mfja_3rd_floor
```

## Quick Check of Recent Additions

The current runtime additions can be validated with four quick checks:

1. Switch commands:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/switch_states std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'A1=EXTERIOR A2=INTERIOR A3=E A4=I'}"
```

2. Reset after `FALLING` without restarting Gazebo:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/shuttle/control_cmd std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'room315_right_shuttle_1=RESET'}"
```

3. Remove and re-add a shuttle:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/shuttle/control_cmd std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'room315_right_shuttle_1=REMOVE'}"
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/shuttle/add_cmd std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'entity=room315_right_shuttle_1 slot=1'}"
```

4. Watch the new right-rail detector stream:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /room_315_right/sensors/position
```

Start slots are numbered as follows:

- `slot 1`: upper indexing pair, right physical position.
- `slot 2`: upper indexing pair, left physical position.
- `slot 3`: lower indexing pair, left physical position.
- `slot 4`: lower indexing pair, right physical position.

## Switch Commands

Switch states are controlled through the rail-specific switch topic, for example
`/room_315_right/switch_states`. Use public station labels `A1` through `A4`
with `EXTERIOR` / `INTERIOR` or the short `E` / `I` forms.

Example:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/switch_states std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'A1=EXTERIOR A2=INTERIOR A3=EXTERIOR A4=INTERIOR'}"
```

The node also republishes visual switch commands on
`/mfja/conveyor/switch_cmd` so the Gazebo switch visuals rotate with the logical
state.

## Stopper and Sensor Workflow

Stoppers are independent from switches. Each stopper has a binary state:

- `0`: open/released.
- `1`: stop/closed.

The public stopper set is `A1`, `A2`, `A3`, and `A4`. The approach sensor topic is:

```text
/room_315_right/sensors/switch_approach
```

The manual teaching workflow is:

```text
sensor -> stop shuttle -> move switch -> unstop shuttle
```

Sensor messages are JSON strings. The `sensors` field is a list, so the same
message can report several shuttles at once. Use `entity_name` to identify the
shuttle associated with each event.

Example:

```json
{
  "sensors": [
    {
      "before_switch": "A1",
      "distance_m": 0.247,
      "entity_name": "room315_right_shuttle_4",
      "segment": "A14",
      "stopper": "A1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This means `room315_right_shuttle_4` is approaching the A1 stopper on segment `A14`,
and the distance to the stop point is about `0.247 m`.

Example:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /room_315_right/sensors/switch_approach
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/stopper_states std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'A1=1'}"
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/switch_states std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'A1=INTERIOR'}"
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/stopper_states std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'A1=0'}"
```

The rail device YAML also defines virtual shuttle position detectors on:

```text
/room_315_right/sensors/position
```

The public detector set is:

- `DZI2R`, `DZI1R`, `DZI4R`, `DZI3R` for the right-rail indexing-zone
  detector positions near the four slot areas.
- `DA1R`, `DA2R`, `DA3R`, `DA4R` on the single-track side of each switch.
- `DA1GR`, `DA2GR`, `DA3GR`, `DA4GR` on the `EXTERIOR` branch.
- `DA1SR`, `DA2SR`, `DA3SR`, `DA4SR` on the `INTERIOR` branch.

Practical use:

- Spawn or reset on `slot 1`, `slot 2`, `slot 3`, and `slot 4` to check the
  nearby `DZI...R` indexing-zone detectors.
- Send `ALL=EXTERIOR` to observe the `...GR` branch detectors.
- Send `ALL=INTERIOR` to observe the `...SR` branch detectors.

## Start Slots

The four allowed start slots are defined in `rail_devices_right.yaml` and
`rail_devices_left.yaml` with `segment` + `s_ratio`. The legacy right-rail
physical positions correspond approximately to:

```text
slot 1: -14.95 -3.86 0.84 0 0 3.14
slot 2: -15.43 -3.86 0.84 0 0 3.14
slot 3: -15.24 -5.54 0.84 0 0 0
slot 4: -14.77 -5.54 0.84 0 0 0
```

Multiple shuttles can be started with `shuttle_count` and `start_slots`, or
added while the node is running through `/room_315_right/shuttle/add_cmd`.

Runtime add commands are rejected when the selected start slot is occupied.

## Shuttle ON/OFF Control

Per-shuttle motion control is available through:

```text
/room_315_right/shuttle/control_cmd
```

Examples:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/shuttle/control_cmd std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'room315_right_shuttle_2=OFF'}"
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/shuttle/control_cmd std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'room315_right_shuttle_2=ON'}"
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/shuttle/control_cmd std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'room315_right_shuttle_2=RESET'}"
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315_right/shuttle/control_cmd std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'room315_right_shuttle_2=REMOVE'}"
```

## Collision Avoidance

Simple center-distance collision avoidance is enabled by default. The default
distance is `0.33 m`. This is not full block occupancy yet; it only prevents
kinematic shuttles from overlapping by stopping a following shuttle when it gets
too close to another active shuttle.
